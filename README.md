# FORENSIC-DENTAL-IDENTIFICATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
My Final Year Project 
The source code is credit to darknet framework and this github repository https://github.com/AarohiSingla/YOLO-v4-Implementation-on-Custom-Dataset.

The steps:
1) Gather dataset
2) Run gpu_testing.py (to check the computer is using GPU or not)
3) Run convert_image_format.py (to convert the image to specific format)
4) Run resize_image.py (to resize the image)
5) Run augmentation.py (to produce more image)
6) Run kfold.py (to split the dataset using stratified k-fold cross-validation)
7) Run training_and_testing.ipnyb (to train and test the dataset)
8) Run confusion_matrix.py (to create confusion matrix manually)

# Run file_name.py if you need to print a list of file names in a folder.

My dataset is confidential.
